- a basic HTTP web-server application which can listen on a configurable TCP port and serve both static HTML and dynamically generated HTML using Python programming language, 
such as in the way Apache uses PHP. 
Support only a restricted subset of HTTP, i.e. GET or POST requests, and the only headers it supports are Content-Type and Content-Length.
